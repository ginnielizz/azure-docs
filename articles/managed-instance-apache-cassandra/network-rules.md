# Required outbound network rules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

The Azure Managed Instance for Apache Casandra service requires certain network rules to properly manage the service. By ensuring you have the proper rules exposed, you can keep your service secure and prevent operational issues.

## Azure Global required network rules

The required network rules and IP address dependencies are:

| Destination Endpoint                                                             | Protocol | Port    | Use  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|------|
|snovap`<region>`.blob.core.windows.net:443</br> Or</br> [ServiceTag](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md#available-service-tags) -  Azure Storage | HTTPS | 443 | Required for secure communication between the nodes and Azure Storage for Control Plane communication and configuration.|
|*.store.core.windows.net:443</br> Or</br> [ServiceTag](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md#available-service-tags) -  Azure Storage | HTTPS | 443 | Required for secure communication between the nodes and Azure Storage for Control Plane communication and configuration.|

## Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra internal port usage

The following ports are only accessible within the VNET (or peered vnets./express routes). Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra instances do not have a public IP and should not be made accessible on the Internet.

| Port | Use |
| ---- | --- |
| 8443 | Internal |
| 9443 | Internal |
| 7001 | Gossip - Used by Cassandra nodes to talk to each other |
| 9042 | Cassandra -Used by clients to connect to Cassandra |
| 7199 | Internal |
